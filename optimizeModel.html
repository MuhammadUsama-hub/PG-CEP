    <li>Seeing from the load profile for 1 A.M to 8 A.M and from 6 P.M to 12 A.M we will use 1 MW

    <li>Seeing from the load profile for 3 A.M to 5 A.M we will use 2.5 MW generators</li>
</ol> <hr>
<h3>So, in nutshell we will use:</h3>
<ol><li>11 MW generator.</li><br>
<li>21.5 MW generator</li><br>
<li>12.5 MW generator</li><br>
<li>In selecting generator units, we will use extra 2.5 MW generator for backup purposes if any of the
    generators goes for maintenance. </li></ol>
    <h2>Improved load profile
    </h2>
    <p>Load profile 2 was improved due to very poor load factor of 33.25%. You can imagine how poorly the
        generation units are running and how poor the revenue is being generated. In this case we have
        improved the selected load profile upto maximum limit keeping in mind all the economic factors and
        technical factors. The following improved load profile is optimum in every respect which is shown
        below</p>

        <h2>Improved Total Consumption</h2>
        <img src="calcimp.JPG" alt="">
        <hr> <p>As you can previously see from load profile section that load profile 2 was the worst with 33.25% load
            factor which is too much poor for any power utility to be taken under consideration. Here we have improved
            load factor with the technique of taking multiple generators keeping in mind all the technical and economic
            factors. Predictive operating schedule has also been given in this section above through which any power
            utility can ponder upon the variation in the demand for any time period of 24 hours</p>
